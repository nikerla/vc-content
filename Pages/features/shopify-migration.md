                        Shopify is designed for small businesses and offers a generic one size fits all checkout experience that you can customize using css. 
						However such customizations are only cosmetic and don't offer a way to dramatically improve your customer experience resulting
						in lost opportunities and revenue. With Virto Commerce you'll be able to completely change how customers shop and purchase your products. 
					</span>
					<span class="descr">
                        Want to offer special terms and pricing for your partners and vendors? Want to allow your vendors to have custom stores with their own themes? 
						Virto Commerce allows all this and much more with innovative B2B features.
