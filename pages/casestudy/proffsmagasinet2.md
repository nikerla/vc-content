                    We are a fast growing business, so we need a platform that would not only
                    allow us to expand, but also keep up with the ever growing needs and demands
                    of our sales strategies. Virto Commerce definitely ticks those boxes
                    being easily scalable and extremely flexible. By switching to this solution, we
                    are adopting technologies that will allow us to add new channels easily and
                    customize the product catalog for each of them, while keeping track of the
                    overall sales and assortment.

                    Sweden's Proffsmagasinet is a leading e-commerce company in the Nordic region that provides
                    tools, laser and measuring apparatus and other equipment for professionals in the building trade with
                    multiple payment and delivery options online.

                <h4>CHALLENGE</h4>
                <p>
                    The company is growing fast! The old system couldn’t keep up with such fast growth and Proffsmagasinet
                    needed to implement lots of new system where the e-commerce platform is the core.
                    Though, the e-commerce platform needed to be able to easily integrate with the ERP system and
                    other third-party systems. Proffsmagasinet wanted to be able to customize the platform according to
                    their need and current business opportunities. The new platform also needed to be able to automatically
                    scale up and down depending on spikes in traffic during campaigns.
