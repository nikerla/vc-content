Just like purchasing any product, whether it is a house, a car or a cell-phone, each particular business has to do its research and correctly determine what it is looking for, remember to consider all the tradeoffs among the available choices. In the past couple years a few of the best ecommerce platforms on the market have been gaining popularity among small businesses thanks to their ease of use, usability, and availability of a large developer community. With some of these top ecommerce platforms, their on-staff web-developers may provide professional services to the platform client; and you will be most likely to receive good support in the long run from a digital commerce platform.

            <div class="glosary-article">
                <p>So, what is the best ecommerce platform? There are hundreds of options available on the market of e-commerce platforms with no single “best ecommerce platform” to really stand out, as they all vary in functionality, features, usability and offer many different choices of building a website, accounting for your personal needs, resources and preferences.</p>
                <p>Some of the universal features that the best ecommerce platforms would have are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Availability of listing and displaying products, with the ability of comparison between them</li>
                    <li>Allowing your buyers to put products into the <a href="{{ '/glossary/hosted-shopping-cart' | absolute_url }}">“Shopping Cart”</a></li>
                    <li>Allowing your customers to place an order from their cart later</li>
                    <li>Collecting payments and offering multiple payment options for the orders</li>
                    <li>Providing the store owner and the customer with information about the order</li>
                    <li>Allowing the customer to place feedback or a review</li>
                </ol>
                <p>And these useful features of the best online store platform do not stop there. Some of the top ecommerce platforms will provide you with certain eccentricities like unique design features, additional security options, marketing tools and so on. With all of that in mind, the best way to go is to choose a digital commerce platform that offers the maximum output for your business and provides you with the most convenience at the lowest cost.</p>

            <p class="glosary-sub-t">Questions to ask yourself while choosing the best online store platform for your business</p>
            <div class="glosary-article">
                <p>While picking the right e commerce platform for you, consider asking yourself the following questions:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Stock size. What is the size of your inventory? Try to find the ecommerce platform where you will be able to create flexible product catalogs with the ability to list thousands of product items without losing website performance.</li>
                    <li>Physical or digital. Do you provide online services or physical products? It will make you think about shipping costs and the ways your product will be delivered to your customer. There are ecommerce platforms that are specifically tied to physical or digital goods’ sales.</li>
                    <li>Payment methods. Not all online store platforms choose third-party payment methods, and you need to consider this as well. PayPal is usually a good option that is easy to use in making arrangements with the best ecommerce platforms. Stripe is also the “must-have” for the platform in 2018.</li>
                    <li>Self-hosted or hosted by the online store platform. The option of self-hosting a website is preferable to you in case you want to control the source code of your online store and modify it on a regular basis. Platform-hosted solutions save your time taking care of server management and system administration.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Considering that choosing a platform can be challenging and daunting, in this article, we wanted to review the top ecommerce platforms that will match your needs and will provide you with a perfect solution for your business.</p>

                <a href="{{ '/glossary/shopify-alternatives' | absolute_url }}">Shopify</a></li> is the best e commerce platform for a website when it comes to balancing the convenience of setting up a website and having the control over it. The great advantage of such category of electronic commerce platforms, including Shopify, is that it provides you with as much control as possible without using your own server. It can get a little bit pricey for small businesses, but the biggest advantage is outstanding customer support and advanced tools for modifying your website. <a href="{{ '/glossary/shopify-alternatives' | absolute_url }}">Shopify</a> deals perfectly with its mission and offers you a robust product experience along with advanced tools for marketing in e-commerce. A website built on this platform would be fast and secure and would have all the necessary features we have brought up earlier in the article. Trying to accommodate all the features that store owners need, Shopify took an example from Apple and Google and started its own App Store. There is no need to go searching a developer every time you need a particular feature in your app anymore - Shopify’s App Store offers a much cheaper and faster alternative.
                <p>Despite having a number of fantastic features, such as great customer service, advanced tools, and App Store, just like any other on the list of the best ecommerce platforms, Shopify lacks certain important tools. Content marketing is the biggest of them. Content marketing has become a huge must-have for an ecommerce website. If your buyers are educated about the solutions your product can provide, they are more likely to buy it. Shopify has a blogging software feature, but it can’t be compared to that of a Wordpress.</p>
            </div>
            <p id="bigcommerce" class="glosary-sub-t">BigCommerce</p>

                    <p>The good thing about this platform is a vast variety of how-tos, advice, and letters about running a successful store. It doesn’t seem very well-organized, but the information from the BigCommerce University will help you to set up and promote your website. Just like Shopify, it provides a hassle-free setup and security with intuitive features and an all-in-one solution for your website.</p>
                    <p>An important thing to consider with this platform is pricing. For a smaller online store, it can get too much very fast. There is a whole number of fees, like monthly fees, credit card fees, platform transaction fees and add-on fees that could drain your budget really quickly. Another one is customization. While having a great variety of built-in options, it lacks add-ons and themes for your website as well as good inventory management. Nevertheless, it’s still commonly named among the top ecommerce platforms.</p>

Given its open-source features and the fact that it is very scalable, Magento has become very popular within the community.

It is represented in the top ecommerce platforms list just like Shopify and BigCommerce and it offers some notable features that are highly appreciated by designers and developers. If you are more dedicated to the operational side of an ecommerce store than to its marketing-led features, you may consider choosing Volusion over BigCommerce. Like Shopify and BigCommerce, Volusion offers a perfect balance between providing everything you need to set up, operate and expand your business and leaving some space for your personal customization. Also, just like BigCommerce, Volusion offers a vast knowledge base, where you can get help setting up an online store of your own.

                <p>Another area where Volusion excels is customer support. The team puts a tremendous amount of effort into making sure their clients have the best experience, thus putting a legit fight for that best ecommerce platform title.</p>
                <p>Having these beautiful features as well as the full range of tools for marketing, Volusion, however, has some of the disadvantages of its own. Just like its two competitors, the big one is, of course, pricing. While having no transaction fees and lower credit card fees compared to the competitors, it does charge a lot of add-on fees, which may turn out to be expensive for a smaller company. Two other disadvantages include limited responsiveness and design options. In the age where most of the people surf the web via smartphones and tablets, it has become the best practice to have a responsive design. As for the design options, Volusion has a fairly limited choice of templates, while also making the new ones very expensive to use, which unfortunately doesn’t  help it with the claim to be the best e commerce platform on the market.</p>
