        <p> NopCommerce is a popular open-source solution that offers its users an ability to create a customizable <a href="{{ '/glossary/hosted-shopping-cart' | absolute_url }}">shopping cart</a> and personalized front-end design of the product <a href="{{ '/glossary/punchout-catalog' | absolute_url }}">catalog</a>. It also provides a convenient way to manage all of the administration work and monitor sales correctly. This platform is well-suited for small and medium businesses, which was proven by 1.5 million downloads.  It’s an open-source platform, so users who have  some coding experience can easily adjust it to suit any specific business needs and demands.  Here are some of the benefits that make NopCommerce such a popular platform:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong> Open-source platform. </strong> Given that this is an open-source solution, you can easily add functionality to it using just your knowledge of programming. </p>
            <li><strong> Responsive design.</strong> The platform allows users to optimize their website’s design to any given device, while still keeping all the functions. </p>
            <li><strong> Multichanneling.</strong> You can create and manage multiple stores with a single NopCommerce installation. </p>
            <li><strong> Multi-Vendor and Drop Shipping Features. </strong> You can start selling products that are not in your inventory by simply connecting with other vendors and redirecting customers to them.</p>
            <li><strong> SEO optimization. </strong> All the web stores built on this platform receive high visibility and rankings in all of the search engines, which makes it possible to promote your products easily.</p>
     </div>
     <div class="text">
            <p>Still, there is no perfect and universal Shopping Cart solution for your business. Even such a popular application as NopCommerce has its downsides, so it’s important to find the right platform for YOU! Therefore, let’s take a look at some of the alternatives to NopCommerce. </p>
            <p>Before we start, however, we should highlight certain features that you should pay careful attention to while choosing <a href="{{ '/glossary/best-ecommerce-platforms' | absolute_url }}">the best platform</a>. </p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong> Open source vs. closed source.  </strong> This is a debate that has been held for too long, but it essentially comes down to one simple thing: if coding is a no-brainer to you, choose open-source and customize the store in any way you desire, but, if coding is not your primary skill, choose a closed source platform where most of the things will be done by the platform. Here is another thing to consider - open-source platforms are almost entirely free to any businesses, but, they lack security. On the other hand, closed-source solutions can get pricey, but they deliver top-notch security protocols to you.</p>
            <li><strong> Plugins and Addons. </strong> Always look for a solution that can be expanded by the plugins and add-ons easily. The platform should uncover your store’s true potential and add value to your products. </p>
            <li><strong> Technological literacy. </strong> If you are going to hire a professional web-developer to do this, you don’t have to worry about choosing an open source solution. If not, pick a sophisticated platform that for a good price will allow you to build your website without breaking a sweat. </p>
