    3dCart is a hosted ecommerce platform that offers a wide variety of features, ranging from content management to store marketing and well beyond. It is an all-in-one store builder that is currently used by more than 16,000 stores. </p>
    <p class="text">
    Stunning platform upgrades now allow for the enhanced graphics and a totally different checkout experience for the customers. The dashboard is intuitive and allows for full control over the store, even if its product listings go way over hundreds of products. </p>
    <p class="text">
    If you have previously worked with Wordpress, this dashboard will seem very familiar to you. The platform offers all kinds templates to help you create the unique look of your store. 61 themes are available to you with a subscription. The other 28 can be purchased starting at $129. The great thing about this platform is that you are not limited to the drag and drop function for creating your front-end, but can also edit the code directly using HTML and CSS. </p>
    <p class="text">
    There is also an app-store you can use to give your website features. The <a href="/b2b-ecommerce-platform">platform</a> itself offers a lot of them, so you won’t need to download multiple add-ons, meaning shorter response time for your website. </p>
    <p class="text">
    All this being said, we have to mention that 3rdCart has its downsides, too. One of them being the limited amount of bandwidth that comes with each plan. If your store gets under 50,000 visits, the bandwidth will be enough for you. However, if you’re hitting higher numbers, the platform will charge additional $5 per 1000 visits. </p>
    <p class="text">
    If this looks like it might be an issue for your business, have a look at some of the most prominent 3dcart alternatives. </p>
    <div class="section-title">Shopify</div>
    <div class="col-w">
        <div class="col __col-30">
            <img alt="3dCart alternatives - Shopify" src="assets/images/3dcart-alternatives-shopify.jpg" />
        </div>
        <div class="col __col-70 text" style="margin-top: 0; padding-left: 20px;">
           <a href="/glossary/shopify-alternatives"> Shopify</a> is one of the popular 3dcart competitors. It combines a convenient process of creating a store with having maximum control over it. 
            The platform is valued by customers all over the world for its intuitive design and tremendous support base that is there to help whenever you need it. A wide variety of tools and extensions is also offered through Shopify’s unique AppStore to help you to broaden your website’s feature base. 
            </div>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
        The only major downside of Shopify is its inability to successfully market products on the Web. Another factor you should consider before you choose this platform is that it’s closed source (proprietary) and requires a significant amount of money to be invested into it. </p>
        <p class="text">
        On the other hand, it means that you don’t have to dig deep into its code in order to customize your website. The easy drag and drop functionality will help you set up fast without any programming involved. Also, the customer support is outstanding and will gladly help you along the way of creating your web store. </p>
        <p class="text">
        Keep in mind though that despite its wonderful features, it may seem hard to scale and customize, due to its close source origin.</p>
    <div class="section-title">Volusion </div>
    <div class="col-w">
        <div class="col __col-70 text" style="margin-top: 0; padding-right: 20px;">
           Another great alternative to 3dcart is <a href="https://www.volusion.com/" rel="nofollow">Volusion</a>. Just like the Shopify, it is also closed source shopping cart software. If you are tech savvy, this platform will impress you with its expandability and functionality. Lots of extensions and plugins are designed specifically to suit your most peculiar needs. 
           The downside is in content marketing functionality (or rather lack of thereof) and design templates as Volusion does not offer many of those. 
           </div>

            </div>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
        What this 3dcart alternative does offer though is a vast knowledge base that can help you with all kinds of questions, as well as guide you through the process of creating your perfect store.  </p>
        <p class="text">
        Just like other large ecommerce platforms (like Shopify and such), this one comes with a large price tag. There are also a lot of add-on fees that can sum up to a noticeable amount of money to pay for a small business owner. </p>
        <div class="section-title">Virto Commerce</div>
    <div class="col-w">
        <div class="col __col-30">
            <img alt="3dCart alternatives - Virto Commerce" src="assets/images/virto-commerce-screen.jpg" />
        </div>
        <div class="col __col-70 text" style="margin-top: 0; padding-left: 20px;">
            Unlike most other 3dcart competitors, this platform is open source and it offers all of the tools and features needed to build a full-fledged web store and to easily set up the processes for selling your products and services. 
            This ecommerce solution is based on .NET 4.5 framework and uses cutting-edge technologies that give you all the freedom and flexibility you need when creating your website. Launch and scale your website using Microsoft cloud and market it with agile features.
